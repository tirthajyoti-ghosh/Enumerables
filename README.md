> Built-in Ruby enum methods written in custom algorithm

Built-in enum methods such as: `#each`, `#each_with_index`, `#select`, `#all?`, `#any?`, `#none?`, `#count`, `#map`, `#inject`. These methods are re-written as an exercise to understand inner workings of Ruby and get comfortable with the language.
